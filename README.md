# CS411-Spring2023

## Description

Welcome to CS411, glad you were able to make it! No seriously, the waitlist for this class if over 300 people... Consider yourself one of the lucky ones. This course is one of the only, if not THE only, course at BU that is specifically structured to focus on PRACTICAL software development tools, techniques, and practices. And hey, what better way to learn software development than having you all work on an actual project!

This repository will contain all resources that I create, use, or show during CS411 labs (specifically sections A2 & A3 I don't know about the other TA's). You may be wondering "Why not just use Piazza?" Well... I think it's better to expose you all navigating GitHub repositories. It's definitely not because it's just way faster for me to do this or anything.

## Contributing

Throughout this semester, I'll be periodically adding things to this repository. If you feel there is something useful that I have not added, just let me know! It literally takes me a few seconds to make updates to this repository (I say this but then something is just going break one day).

## File Structure

Just for fun, here is a tree that shows how the repository is organized.
